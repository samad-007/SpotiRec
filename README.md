- pip (Python package manager)
- Spotify Developer Account
- MongoDB Atlas Account (or local MongoDB instance)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd spotirec
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Then edit `.env` and fill in your actual credentials (see Configuration section below)

5. **Set up Spotify API**
   - Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
   - Create a new application
   - After creation, go to Settings and add `http://127.0.0.1:3000/callback` to Redirect URIs
   - Copy your Client ID and Client Secret and add them to `.env`

6. **Set up MongoDB Atlas**
   - Create a free cluster at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
   - Create a database (e.g., `recommender`)
   - Create a collection for your songs (e.g., `songs`)
   - Get your connection string and add it to `.env`

7. **Populate your MongoDB database**
   
   Your MongoDB collection should have documents with this structure:
   ```json
   {
     "Artist": "The Weeknd",
     "Track": "Blinding Lights",
     "Album": "After Hours",
     "Energy": 0.73,
     "Danceability": 0.51,
     "Valence": 0.33,
     "Loudness": -5.934,
     "Acousticness": 0.001,
     "Liveness": 0.0897,
     "Album_type": "album"
   }
   ```
   
   **Important:** Field names are case-sensitive! Use capitalized field names as shown above.

   Example songs to add:
   ```javascript
   // Connect to your MongoDB and insert sample data
   db.songs.insertMany([
     {
       "title": "Blinding Lights",
       "artist": "The Weeknd",
       "album": "After Hours",
       "genre": "Synth-pop",
       "year": 2019,
       "energy": 0.73,
       "danceability": 0.514,
       "valence": 0.334
     },
     {
       "title": "Levitating",
       "artist": "Dua Lipa",
       "album": "Future Nostalgia",
       "genre": "Pop",
8. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   
   The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`

9. **Open your browser**
   
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Spotify API Credentials
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://127.0.0.1:3000/callback

# MongoDB Connection
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database_name?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# Session Secret (any random string)
SESSION_SECRET=your_random_secret_string

# Server Port
PORT=3000
```

**Security Note:** Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It contains sensitive credentials!

## 🚧 Troubleshooting

### "No recommendations found"
- Make sure your MongoDB collection has songs
- Verify your MongoDB connection string
- Check that song documents have the correct fields

### "Failed to fetch user profile"
- Verify your Spotify credentials in `.env`
- Check that redirect URI matches your Spotify app settings (use `http://127.0.0.1:3000/callback`)
- Ensure you've logged in successfully
- Try logging out and logging in again

### "redirect_uri_mismatch" error
- The redirect URI in `.env` must EXACTLY match what's in Spotify Dashboard
- Use `http://127.0.0.1:3000/callback` (NOT `http://localhost:3000/callback`)
- Make sure to add the redirect URI in Spotify Dashboard Settings AFTER creating the app

### "Cannot connect to MongoDB"
- Verify your MongoDB connection string
- Check that your IP is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas
- Ensure your database user has proper permissions
